This is a simple plugin that takes the RPG plugin, mcMMO, to a harder difficulty. When the player dies, all skill levels are reset to 0. This feature can be turned off per player or even per world with the use of permissions.

As this is an extension to mcMMO...mcMMO is required!

PERMISSIONS:
statreset.user.check - allows usage of the /statreset command.
statreset.user.reset - if true, the player's skills will be reset on death. If false, no stat loss will occur.

COMMANDS:
(/sr is the alias of /statreset)
/statreset - shows if stat reset on death is on/off

CONFIG:
deathMessage - the string that is displayed when a player's stats are reset.
